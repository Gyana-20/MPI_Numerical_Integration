# MPI Numerical Integration

This repository contains the codes for Numerical Integration using **MPI** and **C++**.  
Both **Simpson's Rule** and **Trapezoidal Rule** have been implemented.

The integral  
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{4}{1+x^2} \, dx
\]  
is evaluated using the above rules. Theoretically, this should give us the value of \( \pi \).

## Contents

- **Simpson's Rule**: Code for approximating the integral using Simpson's method.
- **Trapezoidal Rule**: Code for approximating the integral using the trapezoidal method.

## Requirements

- MPI Library (e.g., MPICH or OpenMPI)
- C++ Compiler

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MPI_Numerical_Integration.git
