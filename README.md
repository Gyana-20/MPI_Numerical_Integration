# Program Description

This repository contains the codes for Numerical Integration using **MPI** and **C++**.  
Both **Simpson's Rule** and **Trapezoidal Rule** have been implemented.

The integral  
$$I = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{4}{1+x^2} \hspace{1mm} dx$$
is evaluated using the above rules. Theoretically, this should give us the value of $${\pi} $$ .

## Contents

- **Simpson's Rule**
- **Trapezoidal Rule**

## Requirements
